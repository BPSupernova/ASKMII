All of my header and source files were stored in the following folder/directory: C:\Users\Ben\source\repos\dragonfly\Dragonfly

The Dragonfly.sln solution file was stored in C:\Users\Ben\source\repos\dragonfly

The executable Dragonfly was located in C:\Users\Ben\source\repos\dragonfly\x64\Debug

ALL of my test code and tests to assess the functionality of the game engine are located in Game.cpp and cpp (& their associated header files) files that start with "Test". These tests resemble Saucer Shoot. I made the comments very informative and organized. If you have any questions regarding the tests, please reach out to me. The test code almost entirely prints to the terminal upon running the build in Visual Studio.
